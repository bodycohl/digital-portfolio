                        By combining HTML, CSS and Javascript through React, I was able to simulate a waitlist application that a restaurant might use on both the customer and employee side.

My team wanted to provide our user group access to information about their new home and resources to find roommates, friends, restaurants and activities to allow them to settle into their new home as quickly as possible.

                            In August 2022, I was hired to create a website showcasing a friend's workout plan that she wanted to sell. I created mockups, designed the website from scratch using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, and launched the website to a domain name. I managed to create a cohesive, functional webpage that allows users to learn about the instructor, view recipes for different meals, purchase the workout plan and download the files that become available after purchase.
