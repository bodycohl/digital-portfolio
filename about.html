                                I am currently seeking employment as a frontend engineer or ux/ui product designer. I hope my future career allows me to combine my interests in cohesive and creative design with my education and knowlegde of programming lanugages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to work at an innovative company in the Boston area, but am willing to relocate.

                                While at JMU, I had the privilidge of being a member of Sigma Kappa - Delta Rho Chapter - and held several leadership positions. Most recently, I was the Sisterhood Chairman and was in charge of organizing events for the chapter and promoting connections among our members. It was a great opportunity to enhance my communication and delegation skills as I worked closely with members of the executive council as well as my personal committee. I was also the Webmaster during the 2019 calendar year which allowed me to work on the Sigma Kappa website and restructure the HTML and CSS code to give it a more modern design.

                                During the summer of 2021, I interned at the United States Navy's Undersea Warefare Center in Newport, RI. I worked as a software analyst intern while investigating new data visualization software for research and development projects being completed by the U.S. Navy. Although I am unable to go into great detail about my work, the experience gave me the chance to understand a corporate work environment and collaborate with others through update meetings and detailed documentation.
