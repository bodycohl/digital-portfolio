                                I have attended James Madison University since 2018 and am now approaching graduation this May 2022. I am majoring in Computer Science and am passionate about front-end webpage design and development. I have recently been initiated into Upsilon Pi Epsilon - Zeta Chapter of Virginia, a national Computer Science honors society.

                                Post graduation, I hope to begin a job as a front-end website developer - allowing me to interwind my passion for aesthetic, cohesive design with my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am excited to start working at an innovate company and am looking for jobs in the Boston area, but am willing to relocate.

                                While at JMU, I have had the privilidge of being a member of Sigma Kappa - Delta Rho Chapter - and have held several leadership positions. Most recently, I was the Sisterhood Chairman and was in charge of organizing events for the chapter and promoting connections among our members. It was a great opportunity to enhance my communication and delegation skills as I worked closely with members of the executive council as well as my personal committee. I was also the Webmaster during the 2019 calendar year which allowed me to work on the Sigma Kappa website and restructure the HTML and CSS code to give it a more modern design.

                                During the summer of 2021, I interned at the United States Navy's Undersea Warefare Center in Newport, RI. I worked as a software analyst intern while investigating new data visualization software for projects deemed applicable by the U.S. government. Although I am unable to go into great detail about my work, the experience gave me the chance to understand a corporate work environment and collaborate with others through update meetings and detailed documentation.
